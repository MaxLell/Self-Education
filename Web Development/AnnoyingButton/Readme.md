# The annoying button

This is a fairly easy sketch. Once you hover over the button, the button blinks / teleports to a different location on the screen. 

There is no real chance of capturing the button. The only thing that you can really do, is to hit the TAB key and then press enter 
(Tab selects the next element on the browser window. By doing so you do not need to hover over the button and the button is automatically selected.)

Anyway - just a stupid funny little project, which might be expanded in the future.
