# Hot garbage Event Handling

This is a short experiment on how to NOT do Event Handling in a proper way with the DOM.

2 ways will be shown: 
1. The first is to have inline JS code within the `index.html` file.
2. The second approach shows a function approach which is also not recommended. 

It works for this very simple scenario, but ... this is approach is not suggested by any means for larger projects.
