# Description
This is a simple demo, in which I tinker with Javascript. Object Methods, functions in general

The guiding story of the project is about generating a random deck of cards and some associated functionality is also implemented. Like 'shuffle' the deck. 

The purpose of this project is to test myself and whether I really understood the concepts that I learned before. It is purely for self education.

The code in this project is not maintained. It is only a spike.
